        <h2 class="boots-story-subtitle">My Time on Campus</h2>
        <p class="boots-story-p">During my time on campus, I lived with other orange cats in a cat colony. Many of my orange friends were feral but I was not. My rescuers could tell because my paws were pink and soft when they trapped me. I was originally trapped to be neutered and rerealeased on campus to help with cat overpopulation but my rescuers could not let that happen when they realized I was an indoor cat and I had become very sick. I has acute stomatitis and an ear infection that permanently collapsed my ear canal. Because of this, I had to get all my teeth removed. Ouch!</p>
        <h2 class="boots-story-subtitle">Meeting My Mom</h2>
        <p class="boots-story-p">My Mom first saw me when <a href="https://upurr-club.square.site/">UPurr</a>, a feline rescue club, posted a picture of me for adoption. She had never had a cat before but had a friend who was in UPurr. She instantly fell in love with my sweet face and knew we had to be together! She filled out the application and didn't tell my grandma. When her application got accepted, she came to pick me up at my foster mom's house with her roomate. When I met her, I was terrified! I was like, who is this lady? She took me home to her dorm and I refused to come out from under the bed even though she had so many treats and fun toys for me. She didn't know this was just normal cat behavior! After about a week, I finally jumped on the foot of her bed and would do so every night for about a month until I eventually started sleeping next to her. She was so happy!</p>
        <h2 class="boots-story-subtitle">My Life Now</h2>
        <p class="boots-story-p">My life now is pretty cool. I travel a lot because of my Mom being a college student. My favorite trick is pooping while she's in line to go through security. When we're not travelling, I like to wake up around 4:00AM or 5:00AM for food. After that, I like to nap until it's time to demand food next. Even though I'm a cat, I've learned how to bark when I want my mom to get me food or come back upstairs. I am a very shy boy and even though my Mom's roomates have lived with me for 2 years, I act like they are complete strangers. It's part of my charm. I only come downstairs when she doesn't listen or I hear the microwave open. When I'm not begging for food, I'm likely sleeping, an activity i've been passionate about even when I was with my foster mom. There's a lovely pile of orange hairs on the left side of Mom's bed that despite her cleaning daily, never seems to go away.  </p>
        <h2 class="boots-story-subtitle">My Favorite Things</h2>
        <p class="boots-story-p">My favorite thing in the whole world is my Mom of course. Being an anxious boy, I don't like to be away from her and she doesn't like to be away from me. Despite my mom buying a pink cat hotel for me with many scratch posts, my <a href="https://www.fivebelow.com/products/cat-scratch-tower-155in?variant=3090875-GREY">favorite scratch post</a> is from Five Below. My Mom theorizes that it's my favorite because it curously smells like fish. My other favorite cat item is a box. Yes, a box. My Grandma bought me a fancy box called the <a href="https://www.chewy.com/scratch-lounge-original-scratch/dp/49353?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=Scratch%20Lounge&utm_campaign=20032366012&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwrcKxBhBMEiwAIVF8rNr4MFX4aoit3K6PGf3uVBaW6FKFPpcCFZIqUTT-etXFzTDfbvpO-hoCt8kQAvD_BwE">Scratch Lounge</a> which I am beyond in love with. Despite my several cozy beds, I choose to sit in this box during much of my free time. My final favorite thing is the ikea bag under my Mom's roomate's bed. It has nothing in it but I love it. It is an oasis. I do not like it when the roomate is actually in her room though because how dare she.</p>
