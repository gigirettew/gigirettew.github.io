        <p class="gallery-intro">I am a very handsome boy with a Gen Z Mom which means there are hundreds of pictures of me! Here are 10 of my favorites that show my personality and tell my story! </p>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/wildboots.jpg" alt="Boots on Campus">
    		<figcaption>This stretched image of me is the only one available from my time living on campus. I was rescued by <a href="https://upurr-club.square.site/">UPurr</a>, a University of Miami rescue club who looks after the campus cats and provides medical intervention when necessary.  </figcaption>

    		<img src="images/firstday.jpg" alt="Boots' Adoption Day">
			<figcaption>Here is my mom picking me up from my foster mom's house. She was suprised that I wasn't instantly in love with her. I was like, who the heck is this crazy lady???</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/bootsblanket.jpg" alt="Boots under a blanket for the first time!">
    		<figcaption>This is me laying on my mom's bed for the first time, which was a really big deal! I was getting cozy with her charger. When I first got home I would barely come out from under the bed but then I couldn't resist a cozy blanket!</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/bootsontherug.jpg" alt="Boots on his stomach on the rug">
    		<figcaption>Look at my belly!!!!! For cats, showing our bellies is a huge sign of trust! My foster mom let my Mom know that I love belly rubs but it took some time for me to trust Mom enough to ask for them. Now I ask for them like it's my job!</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/bootsstaring.jpg" alt="Boots staring at mom in the morning">
    		<figcaption>Here's me looking unimpressed after Mom ignored me trying to wake her from 4:00AM to 7:00AM. She's never up during my self-declared meal time so I kindly remind her by digging my claws into her scalp or slapping my stinky toes in her face.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/bootsincar.jpg" alt="Boots in his cat tree">
    		<figcaption>Because my mom lives in two states during the summer and for holidays, we travel a lot! Here is me being a little angel in my passenger seat set up. I was kind enough to not poop my pants on this trip, which was a lovely surprise for mom!</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/bootsandkeon.jpg" alt="Boots and his dad!">
    		<figcaption>Here is a picture of me and my Dad! I truly despise most men, but I actually love him!! Maybe a little more than Mom. Shhhhhhh don't tell her! If she knew, she'd make Dad clean my litterbox every day. </figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/sweaterboots.jpg" alt="Image 8">
    		<figcaption>This is my first and last time trying on a sweater. For some reason, Mom thought I'd love to look like a spooky candy corn, WRONG!!!! When will she understand that I am a distinguished gentleman??</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    		<img src="images/bootswithemma.jpg" alt="Image 9">
    		<figcaption>This is me and my Auntie Emma! Even though she is allergic to me, she is obsessed with me. As you can see by my face, I am not quite obsessed with her. I do like her though, just not when she tries to provoke me for TikTok content. I am a star, just on my own terms. </figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure class="image-container">
    	<img src="images/pillowboots.jpg" alt="Image 10">
    	<figcaption>Finally, here is my Christmas card picture. My Mom hand-selected it for my Grandma. I look so handsome, per usual. I often like to sit my stinky butt right on my Mom's pillow so she has to change the pillowcase even more. I'm such a doll!  </figcaption>
